Robot-Base
=========

Code to run on the base station for my service robot. The base station will monitor and dispense inventory, as well as dispatch the robot based on user requests.

Requires:
* Cereal (https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal)

To install, clone this repo and the cereal repo so they are in the same directory. Then, build with CMake:

`cd robot-base`\
`mkdir build && cd build`\
`cmake ..`\
`make`
